# LSTMs-for-Flow-simulation

The flow simulation is at the core a time series forecasting problem. Here we try to predict the velocity profiles of the fluid in a pipe. The data is given in the two npy files which comprises of the boundary conditions and the parameters required for the flow simulation. 

The results are quite encouraging. As we get pretty close velocity profiles.
